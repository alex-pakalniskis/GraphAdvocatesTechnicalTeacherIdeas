# GraphAdvocatesTechnicalTeacherIdeas

## About

The [issues](https://github.com/alex-pakalniskis/GraphAdvocatesTechnicalTeacherIdeas/issues) in this repository are prototypes of workshop/talk/blog/video ideas for Graph Advocates who self-select the technical teacher role.

## Notes
Ideas are in various stages of completion and currently written in English.
* I strongly encourage collaboration between technical teachers, text translators, event evangelists, etc. to prepare technical content for the non-English speaking community.

This repository will ultimately be archived once DAO creates a similar repo in GraphAdvocates GitHub organization or selects different platform.
